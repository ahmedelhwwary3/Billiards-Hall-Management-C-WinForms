# 🎱 Billiards Hall Management System

A clean and modular Windows Forms application designed to manage a billiards hall system using a **highly reusable UserControl-based architecture**.

## 🧩 Key Concept
The entire system is built around **a single reusable UserControl** that encapsulates all business logic.  
The main forms interact with this control **only through exposed events**, ensuring clean separation between UI and logic.

## 🚀 Features
- Fully reusable UserControl used across the entire system.
- Business logic isolated inside the UserControl.
- Event-driven communication between UI and logic.
- Clean and maintainable WinForms architecture.
- No code duplication.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET WinForms
- Concepts:
  - UserControl reusability
  - Event-driven programming
  - Clean Code
  - Separation of Concerns

## 💡 What This Project Demonstrates
- Deep understanding of WinForms architecture.
- Proper use of events to decouple UI from logic.
- Designing reusable components instead of tightly coupled forms.
- Writing clean, scalable desktop applications.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
